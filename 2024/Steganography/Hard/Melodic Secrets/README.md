## Melodic Secrets

#### Challenge Difficulty: Hard
#### Topic: Audio, Spectogram
#### Author: d151nt3gr4t0r


The challenge provides us with an audio file which has the flag embedded in it. To actually identify the flag, you need to understand what a spectogram is. Feel free to google :)

To read the flag, you need to open the audio with an application that can process and render spectograms such as Audacity.
