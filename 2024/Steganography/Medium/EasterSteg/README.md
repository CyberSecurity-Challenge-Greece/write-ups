The challenge provides us with an image. We can half see the first flag contents, but we seem to be missing the rest of the sequence. 

To solve this challenge we need to use Gimp or Photoshop and edit the Saturation and Hue of the image to the point where it will reveal the rest of the flag.

Flag: csc{y0u_n33d_t0_kn0w_h0w_t0_f1nd_m3}
