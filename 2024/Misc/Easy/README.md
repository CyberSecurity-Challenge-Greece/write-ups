The challenge provides us with a vbs file. A VBE file is an encrypted VBS file. We can decrypt it online using any VBE decryptor.

Once we retrieve the VBS file, we can open it up and identify a few flags. Some of them are flags to throw you off. The real flag is located on a comment.

Flag: csc{n3v3r_run_c0de_y0u_d0nt_7ru5t}
